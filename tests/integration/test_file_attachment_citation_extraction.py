"""
Integration test for file attachment citation extraction functionality.

This test verifies that when files are directly attached to messages (not via FileSearch tool),
OpenAI annotations are properly extracted and made programmatically accessible through
Agency Swarm's citation extraction utilities.

Key distinction: This tests DIRECT FILE ATTACHMENT citations (via file_ids parameter),
not vector store/FileSearch citations which are tested separately.
